## 1 Browserify

Allows to use Node.js style `require()` in the browser by bundling all JS files in into a single
`bundle.js`.

- Install node packages via `npm install`
- Use `browserify` CLI to generate a single output file called `bundle.js` (see `build.sh`)
- Include `bundle.js` in your html files
